# neural-pathway-introspection-prototype

This is a prototype which aims to implement the concept of neural pathways for deep neural network introspection (in this case CNN introspection). The concept originates from the paper "Deep Neural Model Inspection and Comparison via Functional Neuron Pathways" written by J. Fiacco, S. Choudhary and C. P. Rose.

The paper can be found here: <https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1575/>.  
There is also a video in which James Fiacco talks about it, found here: <https://vimeo.com/385434363>.

Note that there might be some parts where I wasn't 100% certain how they were meant to be implemented.  
Note also that some parts that are specificly hardcoded for our test case (i.e. a CIFAR-10 CNN).
